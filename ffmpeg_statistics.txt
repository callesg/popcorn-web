When to use what type of video conversion:

If there is more than 2300 kb/s of bandwith and data is free. use nvenc.
If bandwith is not free like on cellphone use x264
If the screen is small like on a cell phone use x264 and downscale to 480p

Question should x264 ever be used to convert 720p? NAH Whenever we need to use x264 we can also skip HD

Esentialy there are 3 modes:
1. Just switch container.
2. x264 downscale to 480p we just want to watch whatever we want to watch
3. nvenc Just convert to a compatible format We have the bandwith to view in full format
